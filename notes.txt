-> Setting up a react project
    - npx create-react-app my-app
    - cd my-app
    - npm start (This just start the application on port 3000)

---------------------------------------------
-> Every thing we do in react is component.
-> we use "className" to add css styling in here.
-> In public folder/ index.html is the main file on setup and in src is the react code that reders into that file.
-> In index.js we render the app 
    - ReactDOM.render(<App />(what we want to render), document.getElementById('root'));(where we want to render)

---------------------
-> Creating a component
    - create a new js file , import React, { Component } from 'react'
    - we are going to make it stateful class component
    - class Home extends Component{}
    
------
-> we should alter the state directly
-> we can send props from up to down in component tree. we can also send props in class objects 
    props are just arguments.
    <Beta fromAlpha={this.state.alphavalue} />
    Now Beta will receive this prop from alpha , now we have to use this prop
    In Beta 
        - state {
            alphavalue = this.props.fromAlpha(name what we give to prop)
        }

    - To update the state we use setState()
    -------------------
    -> To fill the data in state we use lifecycle method, these are predefined in react.
    -> we can use these methods to perform tasks at different stages.
        - componentDidCatch
        - componentDidMount
        - componentDidUpdate
        - componentWillUpdate
        - componentWillMount - unsafe
        - componentWillUnmount
        - componentWillReceiveProps

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-> we can send childrens into the components with out self closing 
    - <Hello > some child here </Hello>

=> React Routers
    -  npm or yarn -> npm install react-router
    -  in App.js we need to import packages
    -
